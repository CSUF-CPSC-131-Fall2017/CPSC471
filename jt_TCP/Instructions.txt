How to run C++ TCP Client/Server

Open the two terminals. Do the following steps in order:
1. Type gcc TCPClient.cpp -o client and gcc TCPServer.cpp -o server in order to compile the files.
(This must be done in order to allow execution of programs!)
2. Type ./server <PORT NUMBER> in one terminal.
3. Type ./client <SERVER IP> <PORT NUMBER> in another terminal.
Make sure that the number of arguments match or the program will not execute at all!
Also, be sure the port numbers match in order to perform a successful TCP connection.

Now follow the steps for the client and server windows:

Client
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Type in the message when prompted by the screen.
2. Wait for the program to send the message over to the server.
3. Once that is done, the program will end. Be sure to type ./client <SERVER IP> <PORT NUMBER> again to do another run.


Server
--------------------------------------------------------
1. By default, the server will wait for the client's request to connect.
2. Once the connection is successful, the server will continue to run indefinitely and receive messages from client.
3. Leave the window open if you want to continue the server; otherwise, close the window to end the program.
