Import the socket.

Check if the number of arguments are valid.
If len(sys.argv) < 2:
	Print "USAGE python " + sys.argv[0] + " <FILE NAME>"
	Exit the program.

Declare a server address and choose any name.
Declare a server port number and select any number.
Declare a file name variable and assign sys.argv[1] to it.
Try to open the file as read-only if possible.
Create a new client socket and set it to AF_INET and TCP mode.
Now connect to the server using its address and port number.

While True:
	Create a new data variable and store the number of bytes from the text file into it.
	
	If end-of-line is not reached for the text file:
		Create a data size string and assign the string of size of read data to it.
		Create a variable that will read the number of bytes sent.
		Prepend the size of data to file data.
		While size of file data > bytes sent:
			Have client socket send the bytes of data over and add to bytes sent variable.
	
	Else:
		Break out of the while loop.

Print the number of bytes sent.
Close the client socket.
